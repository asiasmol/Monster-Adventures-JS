### ✨ Monster Adventures



Welcome to Monster Adventures, a project inspired by the popular Dino Game. In this exciting game, the main characters are: a zombie, a spider, and a carrot.

To control your character, use left and right arrow keys, and the spacebar to jump over obstacles. The key to success is to time your jumps perfectly and react quickly to avoid obstacles.

Your goal is to survive for as long as possible and jump over as many rocks as you can. The longer you survive, the higher your score will be. But beware, one mistake and it's game over.

Do you want to try yourself in our game? So test yourself at : https://stelmaszczykadrian.github.io/Monster-Adventures/


Good luck! Jump over them all to become the best!
